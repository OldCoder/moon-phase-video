"moon-phase-video" notes                               Revised: 120709
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Overview.

1.1. "moon-phase-video"  is  a set of Perl 5 programs that generates a
short  video clip showing  one month in the life of the Moon. Both GIF
animation and AVI versions are produced.

To see the  video clip, go to the "examples" directory which is stored
next  to this README file and view the  GIF file(s) there using a  web
browser or "viewnior" (a program linked at a later point). Or view the
AVI file(s) using a  standard multimedia player  such as  "mplayer" or
"vlc".

There are three source files (two Perl5 programs and one data file):

(a) moonphasepic  - Perl5 program that generates a single video frame.

(b) moonphase2avi - Perl5 program that calls "moonphasepic" repeatedly
to generate individual frames, then combines the frames to produce ei-
ther an animated GIF or an AVI file.

(c) albedo_simp750.jpg - Base image used by "moonphasepic".

1.2. "moon-phase-video" was created by OldCoder:

2. Requirements.

Requirements are  moderately  stringent.  To use this package,  you'll
need:

Linux, Perl 5.8 or above, ImageMagick (or "imagemagick") 6.3 or above,
"mencoder"(often bundled with "mplayer"), POV-Ray (or "povray") 3.6.1,
"gifsicle" 1.48 or above,  "intergif" 6.15 or above,  and release 0.60
or above of a CPAN module named Astro::MoonPhase.

Perl comes preinstalled in most Linux distros.

"imagemagick", "mencoder",  and "povray" are  generally available from
Linux distro repositories.

"gifsicle" and  "intergif"  may be  available from distro repositories
or,  for some distros,  you may need to build these  two programs from
source code.

Astro::MoonPhase is  available  from CPAN.  For more information about
CPAN, see the associated link below.

3. Installation.

No "build" is needed.

To install  the  package, simply copy the three source files listed in
part 1 to wherever you'd like to store them.  The files should go into
the same directory and  the user should have  read, write, and execute
permissions for the directory.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Usage.

4.1. Displaying documentation.

To use  either of the Perl5 scripts provided, go to the directory that
holds them and execute a command of the form:

      perl FILENAME.pl

Alternatively,  remove the ".pl" filename extensions and set file per-
missions to 755 octal. If this is done, commands of the following form
should work:

      FILENAME          # If "." is     in PATH
or  ./FILENAME          # If "." is not in PATH

If no command-line arguments are specified, program documentation will
be printed in each case.

4.2. "moonphase2avi" summary.

Usage:  moonphase2avi --avi         # Make high-quality AVI
        moonphase2avi --gif         # Make animated GIF instead
        moonphase2avi --needs       # List software requirements
        moonphase2avi --license     # Show license information

"--avi" creates  an AVI file  called "moonphase.avi" that displays one
month in the life of  the Moon.  The AVI file is MPEG4-encoded. You'll
need  write  access to  the  current directory and  about 8 MB of disk
space. However, the AVI file is only about 210 KB in size.

"--gif" is similar, but  it  creates a low-resolution animated GIF in-
stead of an AVI.

For software requirements or license information, specify "--needs" or
"--license".

4.3. "moonphasepic" summary.

Usage:  moonphasepic now   --output=foo.png
        moonphasepic 0.52  --output=foo.png

        --info=foo.txt    Create an informational text file
        --width=360       Change image width

This program creates a PNG image file. The image shows the Moon with a
phase shadow added.

"--output" specifies the image-file name (or pathname).  If "--output"
isn't used, the image is saved to  "moonphase.png" in  the user's home
directory.

If "now" is specified, the phase is based on the current date.  A num-
ber between  zero and  one (inclusive) may be  specified instead.  The
number specifies a point  in the lunar cycle  (for example: zero = New
Moon, 0.25 = 1st quarter, 0.50 = Full Moon, and 0.75 = 3rd quarter).

"--info=foo.txt" writes a short description of the image to the speci-
fied text file. If "--info" isn't used, no text file is created.

To change the image width, use "--width" as shown above.
